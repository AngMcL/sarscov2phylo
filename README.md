# Phylogenetics for SARS-CoV-2

This repository contains scripts for reproducible analyses of SARS-CoV-2 data using GISAID

For many analyses, running your own phylogenies won't be necessary - one can simply use the excellent NextStrain pipeline (particularly augur, for the phylogenetics).

We wanted to build something that did a little more than augur though, which means first solving a few problems in different ways, hence this repository. We hope that if the methods prove useful, we'll have time to build them into augur at a later date.
