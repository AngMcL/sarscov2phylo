# GISAID acknowledgements

Until about the 24th of June, GISAID acknowledgements were provided in tabulated form on their website so could be combined into a single file. This file is the .tsv file in this folder.

Subsequent to about the 24th of June, GISAID shifted to only allow PDF downloads of this table. It is not possible though to download the entire table at once, only small subsections of it. As a result, acknowledgements after the 24th of June are provided in the .pdf files that are dated accordingly.

This statement applies to the combined PDFs and .tsv files:
We gratefully acknowledge the following Authors from the Originating laboratories responsible for obtaining the specimens, as well as the Submitting laboratories where the genome data were generated and shared via GISAID, on which this research is based.
