hCoV-19/England/20134024504/2020|EPI_ISL_423128|2020-03-23	excluded because it has an additional 't' around position 22K of the global alignment which which probably shouldn't be there
hCoV-19/Australia/VIC555/2020|EPI_ISL_426816|2020-03-25	excluded because there's an entire missing codon around position 200 of the alignment. MAFFT fails to align the resulting sequence correctly (it could be corrected by hand, however), leading to a silly alignment with an apparently large number of substitutions
hCoV-19/Wales/PHWC-26E28/2020|EPI_ISL_422159|2020-03-29	excluded because the sequence has a bunch of garbage (maybe it's alignable if you try, but MAFFT can't find a good alignment) and a large deletion around 27K of the global alignment
hCoV-19/USA/WI-GMF-00227/2020|EPI_ISL_418186|2020-03-23	excluded because it has this sequence near the start of the first ORF, the latter part of which is clearly wrong when you look at the alignment CNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGCGGTGATCA
hCoV-19/USA/UN-UW-1402/2020|EPI_ISL_424181|2020-03-16	excluded because it has this sequence near the strat of the fist ORF, the latter part of which is clearly wrong wehn you look at the alignment CNNNNNNNTCTACAGCCACAAG
hCoV-19/Shandong/LY001/2020|EPI_ISL_414934|2020-01-21	excluded because it has >>20 singletons which seem likely to indicate low quality
hCoV-19/Spain/Valencia9/2020|EPI_ISL_417205|2020-03-02	excluded because it has this in the alignment, which is obviously wrong in context NNAGANCAGCNTATNTGTACTCAANAACTGCCACTA

hCoV-19/Senegal/610/2020|EPI_ISL_420075|2020-03-20	excluded because it has a few stretches (one at the end, one near the start) with incorrect basecalls in a string e.g. NNNGCAGAGCAGTGCTCT
hCoV-19/England/20140063904/2020|EPI_ISL_423392|2020-03-29	excluded because it has an odd artefact where there is frequently an incorrect? singleton basecall at the end of a row of N's, e.g. the final G here CAAACAGGTTCATCTAAGTGTGTGTGTGNNN
